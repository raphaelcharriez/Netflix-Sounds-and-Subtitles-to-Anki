137
00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:45.186 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Ryo Asuka. We're the same age,
but he's a professor in the States.

138
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:46.103 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

144
00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:09.543 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A machine gun.

145
00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:10.878 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

146
00:11:11.253 --> 00:11:13.464 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You can't survive by obeying laws.

00:11:13.714 --> 00:11:17.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You can't drive in Japan

149
00:11:20.096 --> 00:11:23.224 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I couldn't track your GPS,
so I tracked the girl's.

-Why do you run?

151
00:11:26.894 --> 00:11:29.563 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It's common in track.
People ask a lot.

152
00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:31.649 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The human ability of movement

153
00:11:31.732 --> 00:11:35.236 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33%

154
00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:39.281 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Weapons and vehicles are what bring out
the abilities of humans.

155
00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:47.957 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fikira died last month.
He was a Russian scholar.

00:11:59.343 --> 00:12:00.511 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Professor Fikira?

160
00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:04.348 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

161
00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.228 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Professor.

162
00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:16.819 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The chirping birds were getting

163
00:12:17.194 --> 00:12:19.071 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
But they're caught now, finally.

164
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.739 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

165
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.924 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
That can't be.

166
00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:55.900 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

167
00:13:02.406 --> 00:13:03.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

168
00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:07.536 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I can't keep it down.

169
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:09.830 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must die while I'm still human.

170
00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:12.833 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Damn it.

171
00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.337 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
No, you'll explode.

172
00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:19.590 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
A shame, since I came
to know more about you.

173
00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:31.769 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You devil. Damn it.

174
00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:48.035 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fikira's burnt corpse weighed
twice as much as he did when he was alive.

175
00:13:48.911 --> 00:13:51.664 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Twice as heavy,
even though he was charred.

176
00:13:51.747 --> 00:13:53.541 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Something was inside him.

177
00:13:55.167 --> 00:13:56.168 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Something?

178
00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:57.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A devil.

179
00:13:57.753 --> 00:13:58.587 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
A devil?

180
00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:02.299 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The natives he was researching
were the devils.

181
00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:07.346 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Devils have existed
on Earth since long before humans.

182
00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:11.392 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They are ferocious, extremely savage,
and have no emotion.

183
00:14:11.767 --> 00:14:15.729 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But they are creatures skilled at fighting
and surviving.

184
00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:19.275 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
No devil has ever
been seen in its true form.

185
00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:23.946 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They cannot exist unless they
merge with some living thing.

186
00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:27.032 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They merged
with superior creatures each time

187
00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:28.492 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
in order to survive,

188
00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.745 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
keeping their abilities and evolving.

189
00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:34.999 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You mean the extra weight was a devil?

190
00:14:35.249 --> 00:14:38.586 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And now there are devils
who have gained the ability

191
00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:41.672 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
to live while still keeping a human body.

192
00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:45.968 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
On the other hand,
if we don't lose to the devil's will,

193
00:14:46.176 --> 00:14:50.306 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
it's possible to gain its power
while remaining a human.

194
00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:54.268 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Fikira probably tried
to prove that with his own body.

195
00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:58.355 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But he failed.
There have been a lot of cases lately

196
00:14:58.439 --> 00:15:00.858 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
of brutal unsolved mysteries.

197
00:15:00.941 --> 00:15:05.279 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Strange mass disappearances,
reports of unprecedented violence,

198
00:15:05.362 --> 00:15:08.824 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
athletes who suddenly show
astounding physical abilities,

199
00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.868 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
and other things seen by people.

200
00:15:10.951 --> 00:15:14.747 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Those phenomena dovetail perfectly
and can be explained easily.

201
00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:16.832 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
The devils are spreading.

202
00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:20.544 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
The heads of police
and the Public Security Division

203
00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:22.796 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
around the world must know.

204
00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:27.134 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Why haven't they made it public?
-They're scared of a panic.

205
00:15:27.217 --> 00:15:30.095 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But if it's the truth,
everyone should know.

206
00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:34.892 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
It'll be a disaster if people don't
take precautionary measures on their own.

207
00:15:34.975 --> 00:15:36.685 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
If Fikira's hypothesis is true,

208
00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:41.440 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
we're going to confirm it, get evidence,
and tell the world. That's my mission.

209
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:47.404 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is it here?

210
00:15:56.538 --> 00:15:58.582 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Sorry for dragging you into this.

211
00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:02.086 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
If possible,
I wanted to find out the truth with you.

212
00:16:02.169 --> 00:16:06.548 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But there's a big risk that comes with it.
You might get eaten by a devil,

213
00:16:06.632 --> 00:16:10.636 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
or end up pouring gasoline over your head,
just like Fikira.

214
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.639 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ryo, why me?

215
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:15.391 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm scared.

216
00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.434 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I'm so terrified.

217
00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:21.522 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
This is a horrific legacy
that Fikira left me.

218
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.316 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I must find out the truth.

219
00:16:24.858 --> 00:16:28.821 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
And I wanted to tell this to you
before anyone else,

220
00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:30.155 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
as soon as I could.

221
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.200 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're the only one I can trust.

222
00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:37.413 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I need your help.
We're gonna tell everyone the truth.

223
00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:41.250 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
When we go back alive,
everyone will thank us.

224
00:16:42.918 --> 00:16:43.752 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks.

225
00:16:44.044 --> 00:16:45.129 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Okay, Ryo.

226
00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:47.423 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
I trust you, Ryo.

227
00:16:48.924 --> 00:16:49.883 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Thanks, Akira.

228
00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:51.051 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Let's go.

229
00:16:52.052 --> 00:16:53.929 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's no going back.

230
00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:56.390 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
We're going to prove devils exist!

231
00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:18.746 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Here you go.

232
00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:24.376 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Do you prefer Devidevi?

233
00:17:33.927 --> 00:17:35.137 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Is he a first-timer?

234
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.598 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Yeah,
he just got dumped by his girl.

235
00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:38.515 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
He's cute.

236
00:17:39.349 --> 00:17:41.018 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Hope to bump into you later.

237
00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:01.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
It's Sabbath, the latest popular party.

238
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:03.916 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What? Are we going to summon the devil?

239
00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:09.254 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
I know the Sabbath party is
where people get possessed by devils.

240
00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:12.674 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
But the devil won't come
to a fake scene like this.

241
00:18:18.847 --> 00:18:19.681 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ryo.

242
00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:33.987 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Demons love blood.

243
00:18:35.948 --> 00:18:36.782 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Ryo.

244
00:18:37.324 --> 00:18:38.367 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What's wrong?

245
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:39.284 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
What is it?

246
00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:41.078 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
There's blood!

247

249
00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:47.334 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
Both Black Mass
and Sabbath come with blood.

250
00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:50.087 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Blood.

251
00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:51.880 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Blood! Blood!

252
00:18:58.011 --> 00:19:00.514 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
Stop! Ryo, stop it!

253
00:19:00.597 --> 00:19:03.809 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
They're all scum anyway.
There's no need to be sad.

254
00:19:03.892 --> 00:19:05.435 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67% 
You're scum, too!

255
00:19:07.938 --> 00:19:09.398 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
-Ryo!
-You, too!

256
00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:21.869 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:79.33% 
You want to touch my boobs?
Look behind you.

257
00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:23.787 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

258
00:20:06.663 --> 00:20:07.497 position:50.00%,middle align:middle size:80.00% line:84.67%

259

263

264
